EDA_Projects
EDA projects are a crucial part of data science and analytics. They involve exploring a dataset to summarize its main characteristics, often using visualization techniques, statistics, and data wrangling.

üîç What Happens in an EDA Project?
Here are the typical steps:

Understand the Dataset

Load the dataset (CSV, Excel, SQL, etc.)

Understand the context, columns, data types, and missing values

Clean the Data

Handle missing values

Remove duplicates

Correct data types

Handle outliers

Univariate Analysis

Distribution of each variable (histograms, box plots)

Value counts (for categorical variables)

Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis

Correlation matrix

Scatter plots, heatmaps

Grouped bar plots, pair plots

Feature Engineering (optional)

Create new features from existing ones

Visualizations

Charts and plots to reveal patterns/trends

Insights Summary

Write a summary of findings

Include questions answered by EDA (e.g., Which category sells most?)

üìä Popular Datasets for EDA Projects
Here are some common ones:

Dataset	Description
Titanic	Passenger survival analysis
Iris	Flower classification and visualization
Airbnb NYC	Prices and locations analysis
Sales Data	Trend, seasonality, product performance
MovieLens	Ratings, genre, popularity of movies
COVID-19	Case trends over time and location
Spotify/Netflix	Popularity of songs/movies

üí° Sample EDA Projects Ideas
Sales Analysis: Analyze a company‚Äôs sales data to find best-selling products, seasonal trends, etc.

Employee Attrition: Investigate reasons why employees leave the company.

Loan Default: Understand which features predict loan repayment issues.

Real Estate Prices: Find what drives housing prices in a city.

‚öôÔ∏è Tools You Can Use
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Jupyter Notebook

Power BI / Tableau (for dashboard-based EDA)

Excel (for smaller datasets or quick summaries)
